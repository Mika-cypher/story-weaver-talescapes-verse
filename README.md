# Talescapes | Digital Storytelling & Cultural Archiving Platform

**Talescapes** is a web-based platform dedicated to archiving and sharing African stories, folklore, and cultural narratives. In an era where oral histories are fading, Talescapes serves as a digital repository to preserve these narratives, bridging the gap between traditional storytelling and modern technology.

## 🚀 Project Vision

This project explores the intersection of **Creative Technology** and **Cultural Preservation**. While currently a web interface for reading and contributing stories, the long-term roadmap involves integrating **Augmented Reality (AR)** to allow users to visualize cultural artifacts (such as masks and sculptures) alongside their respective stories.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Cultural Repository:** A searchable database of African folktales and historical narratives.
- **User Contribution:** Secure authentication allowing community members to submit and curate stories.
- **Modern UI/UX:** A responsive, accessible interface designed to focus on the reading experience.
- **Tagging System:** Categorization by region, tribe, and theme (e.g., "Yoruba," "Folklore," "West Africa").

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using modern web development practices and a component-driven architecture.

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui (for accessible component primitives)
- **Backend/Auth:** Supabase (Authentication & Database)
- **State Management:** React Hooks
- **Deployment:** [Insert Deployment Link if active, e.g., Vercel/Netlify]

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (Creative Tech)

- **AR Integration:** Prototyping WebXR features to display 3D models of African masks (Baule, Benin Bronze, etc.) when reading related stories.
- **Audio Narration:** Text-to-speech integration for accessibility and oral storytelling preservation.
